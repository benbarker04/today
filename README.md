## Profile Page
- Each user has their own profile page which will show that user's posts, follower count and following count.
- on the right side of the profile page is a 'popular profiles' list which shows a list of the most popular accounts, this is also on the home, feed and liked page.
= If you are viewing another user's profile page a follow button will appear to the right of the following count which you can press to follow that user.

## The Home Page
- when a user is logged in the home page will show you an infinite scrolling feed of posts other users have posted but if you are logged out it will show you the sign-up form.
- Just like the profile page the home page has a popular profile list so you can follow popular users from there.
- above the posts is a search bar where you can search posts by usernames and keywords.
- When you click on a post it will take you to the post view page.
- on the home page you can like posts but you can also see how many comments and likes it has.

## The Liked and Feed page
- the liked and feed pages are very similar to the home page but it will show you posts you have liked if you are on the liked page and posts of users you follow if you are on the feed page.


## The post view page
- The post view page is a more in-depth page of the post you click this is where you can edit or delete your post by clicking the 3 dots in the corner of the post.

- Underneath the post on this page is where you can see and post comments on other users' posts.
